## Background
* Use less time on updating the same bundle and test framework code in different libraries.
* Quicker bundling and test setup when creating new libraries.
* As few dependencies as possible, or a good balance between dependencies and function, to not have minor updates all the time.

## Goal
Easy setup of
* Tape tests in Node.js
* Tape tests in browser
* User-like interaction tests in browser
